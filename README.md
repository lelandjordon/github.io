This is my ever-evolving portfolio site.

It was initially created as part of the pre-work assignments prior to the start of
the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in DC.

If you look through the older commits, you'll see quite a few changes to how the
site was written and organized.  I'll continue making adjustments as I learn
new skills and include more content.
